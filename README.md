<h1> Conducting an Incident Response Investigation for a Suspicious Login Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This lab offered me a hands-on learning opportunity. I was able to obtain the skills to recognize potentially compromised login details from FTP packet traces, assess the information sought by potential attackers, scrutinize digital forensic evidence, establish connections between various pieces of evidence to reinforce their case, organize and save suspicious data, and compile thorough reports covering email communication, attachments, and FTP session data. This lab provided me with critical competencies in the realms of network security and digital forensics, enhancing my ability to comprehend, identify, and address potential security risks and breaches in future real-life scenarios.
